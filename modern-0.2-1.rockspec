   summary = "A module/mixin system written in the Lua programming language.",
   detailed = [[
      A module can be thought of as a unit (of code), which is used to facilitate
      a more complex purpose (our program). Lua doesn't naturally come pre-built with
      the idea of a `class`, however it offers the power of `metatables` to imitate
      inheritance. This idea is the main idea behind `Modern`, but with a bit more.
